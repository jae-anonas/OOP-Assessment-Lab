5. Define the term constructor.

Answer: A constructor is like a method/function that has no return value and has the same name as its class. It is
typically used to instantiate the member variables of the class when an object of that class is created. It is used
in conjunction with the "new" keyword.

7. Describe the purpose of overriding a method.

same method name, but with a different purpose. It makes for more readable code and easier learning.
